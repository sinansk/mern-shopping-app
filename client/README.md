It is a MERN stack e-commerce application. You can register, login and order something with Stripe payment method. I used Redux for the state management, styled components for styling and Material UÄ± for the icons.\

 You can checkout with the credit card number as: 4242 4242 4242 4242, valid date: any future date and CVC: 123. I am going to add new features such as deleting account and admin dashboard! I deployed backend on Heroku, and frontend on Netlify.
